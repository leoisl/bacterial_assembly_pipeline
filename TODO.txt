TODO assembly:
    - Create own id for assemblies
        - <data>-<sample>
        - ilmn-SAMEA<xyz>
	- Create a table:
	    - own_id, sample_id, run_ids (for the 661k as well)
    - new release next week

- TODO workflow:
	- kraken/bracken with gtdb+human on reads;
	    - experiment first;
	- CheckM, QUAST and human/mouse-decontamination on contigs to remove host;
	- Making output of kracken output;

- Think about:
    - Samples not covered by kraken db
    - improve mof-compress to easily apply it to assemblies without using other stats
    - versioning of dataset
